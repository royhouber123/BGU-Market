# Demo Data Population Script

This script populates your BGU Market application with demo data to make it ready for frontend testing and development.

## Prerequisites

1. **Server Running**: Make sure your BGU Market backend server is running on `http://localhost:8080`
2. **Clean Database**: For best results, start with a clean database state
3. **curl**: The script uses curl for API calls (should be available on most systems)

## How to Run

1. **Start the Backend Server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Run the Demo Data Script**:
   ```bash
   ./populate_demo_data.sh
   ```

## Testing the Frontend

After running the script, you can test the frontend with:

1. **Login** with any demo user (e.g., `alice:password123`)
2. **Browse stores** and view products
3. **Search for products** (try searching "iPhone" or "Book")
4. **Add products to cart**
5. **Execute purchases**
6. **Manage stores** (if logged in as store owner)

## Verification

The script includes verification steps that:
- ‚úÖ Check all stores and products were created
- ‚úÖ Test product search functionality  
- ‚úÖ Test product sorting by price

## Troubleshooting

**Script fails with connection errors**:
- Make sure the backend server is running on `http://localhost:8080`
- Check if the server is fully started (look for "Started BguMarketApplication" in logs)

**Some operations fail**:
- This is normal - some business logic constraints may prevent certain operations
- The script continues on failures to populate as much data as possible

**Want to reset data**:
- Restart the backend server to reset to clean state
- Run the script again

## Customization

You can modify the script to:
- Change the `BASE_URL` if your server runs on a different port
- Add more users, stores, or products by editing the arrays
- Modify product prices, quantities, or descriptions
- Add different product categories

## Next Steps

Once the demo data is populated, your application is ready for:
- Frontend development and testing
- User acceptance testing
- Demo presentations
- Integration testing

The data provides a realistic marketplace scenario with multiple stores, diverse products, and various user types to test all application features.
